      <description>This post is about how to configurate a raspberry pi with pihole to block advertisements. I discovered Pihole on a CTF and was cool to have one !
I was bored this weekend and tired about the advertisements. So I decided to configure a Pihole, this post contains simple work memory used on the process.
 ESPECIAL THANKS to my friend Mario who just changed a raspberry pi for a few beers!</description>
