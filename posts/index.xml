      <description>This post is a temporal fix for the framework Veil on Kali Linux.
Veil-Evasion is a framework used to generate metasploit payloads that can bypass old AVs and other defenses. It is outdated and is strange that can bypass modern AVs but sometimes can be useful for CTFs and outdated software.
Note: This solution worked for me but maybe you need to do something more, take this post with caution.</description>

      <description>Instead to make another Hello world page or enumerating the reasons of writting a new blog, this is a writeup of how this site was build. Is a good way to make the first page useful and serve as work a memory. Maybe i can help me or someone in the future.
